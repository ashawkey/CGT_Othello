## Computational Game Theory: Player

This is an implementation of a **strong loopy solver** for simple games, and also two players (general CMD version and specific GUI version for Othello).

Currently coded games include:

1. One To Ten
2. Odd Even
3. Othello (of board size less than 4*5)

### How to play

Run `cmdPlayer.py` or `guiPlayer.py` directly, then follow the built-in help.

You need to solve the game and save the generated SQLite database first.

Note the game of Othello takes lot of time and space to solve for size larger than 5*4.
